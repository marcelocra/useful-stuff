# A bunch of **_usefull-stuff_**

This repo is a gathering of standalone helpers, scripts and ideas that I'm using
across projects.

Each project has their own README.md (which I'll eventually figure out how to
merge here automatically), so check out the folders' names and, if interested,
go for their READMEs.
